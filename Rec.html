	<h2 id="phi"> Phigros </h2>
	
	<div class="main">
	<p id="phif"> Phigros is a "laneless" Rhythm Game which the line where you need to tap will move on its own. This concept is limitless and some of the charters takes advantage of it to test your skills. Would likely to recommend a blind playthrough because recently they released the Main Chapter 8 story.</p>

	<h2 id="cel"> Celeste </h2>
	
	<p id="ceinf"> Celeste is special to me because it is a game about climbing a mountain. You control Madeline and on her journey to overcome her mountainous anxiety and fear. With each attempt and getting closer and closer at the top and with the story with it will make you emphatize with her journey. If you are struggling, try to play this game and do not worry, there are accessibility options where you can enjoy the story without frustration. </p>

	<h2 id="get"> Getting over It </h2>
	
	<p id="over"> This is a game where you climb a mountain. You control Madeli- nah I'm only half joking come on this is THE 2015 rage game and I find it charming, yet on my first attempt at climbing it was I fell even I got at the final area but I succeeded and everytime you get over it feels refreshing and if you get the streak going then you are showing Benneth Foddy what you can do and beat him at his own game literally. Must play and I warn you, this will make you rage.</p>

	<h2 id="lea"> CrossCode </h2>

	<p id="apollo"> This is one of the hidden gems of gaming. <a style ="text-decoration: none;" href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/368340/discussions/0/1291817208507901095/"> It is made solely on HTML 5!!! </a> and it was released for early access on May 15, 2015 and it's official release was September 20, 2018. This is by far is the best rpg every and its story is phenomenal. The problem is..... I didn't finish it yet, but bear with me the combat of this game is flawless because it combines both melee and ranged combat. Its immersive story will put you in the games world. </p>
