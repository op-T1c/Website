	<h2 id="berb"> Berb & Lia (2018-2021)</h2>
	
	<p id="binf"> For a while I've only drawn Berb because of a certain <a style ="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRei8TBpt4r0WPZ7MkiKmVg"> Youtuber</a>. Until then, an idea popped into my mind thinking that how about making another character which can be a companion for Berb? At the point Lia was made and I used them for my first magnum opus, a parody of <a style ="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyneiz9FRMw"> Akari has Arrived („Ç¢„Ç´„É™„Åå„ÇÑ„Å£„Å¶„Åç„Åü„Åû„Å£)</a>. Which titled "Berb & Lia has Arrived" (cool title I know) which started on April 9, 2020 until April 29, 2020. I have spent days drawing all the separate images and edited it and in the end I was proud of it.</p>

	<h2 id="app"> Java Applet </h2>
	
	<p id="ainf"> On April 2022 our teacher Eng. Villiamor grouped us for our reporting, and our group got Java Applet. We had trouble finding how it works and I stumble upon the Oracle site that Java applets were discontinued on 2015. I on the other hand still wanted to explore more about it and discovered that Java Platform SE 8 can work with console command to set up your own applet offline. The presentation was a success.</p>

	<p id="finf"> This is my favorite magnum opus because it took me a while to do because of procrastinating. It is our final project of our subject Object Oriented Programming and our instructor for it is Eng. Villiamor. If I recall the deadline was a month and I did it in less than a week before the deadline. (and for this website too but in 2 days) For a while I do not know what kind of program to do and the items on my bedroom gave me an idea, and the 3 major characters for the game was done. After a while I kept thinking for what puzzles I should put on it and the hard work was worth it. </p>

	<h2 id="w1"> Website </h2>

	<p id="winf"> The latest magnum opus which is the website you are looking at right now. Because I am a master of procrastinating I only did this for at least 3 days and it is now currently 9:30pm and I didn't started the Codes and Recommendations pages at the moment üíÄüíÄüíÄ. But I am loving at what my website is looking right now than before. </p>
