	<h2 id="pld"> C++ </h2>
	
	<p id="cinf"> It is my first time learning how to code my very first program and it was hard and our instructor did well for us and to me because I got creative on how to code my own C++ side programs than the ones our instructor requires. Here is the Square Maker program that askes a user for an integer and it will make a square with how many integers the user has inputted. Programming Logic and Design taught me how to think more with my logic and my creativity,	</p>

	<h2 id="oop"> Java </h2>
	
	<p id="oinf"> Object Oriented Programming showed me how to create my own programs with the Java language and with that I can tweak out the UI and how good the UX is. With the logic on PLD and now with more functions to remember, this subject opened my mind more on how to get creative hence "Untitled_168" or as I called it <a style ="text-decoration: none;" href="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\Site\Achi.html"> "Frames"</a> which is one of my magnum opus. This program shows how to do a sample applet.</p>

	<h2 id="py"> Python </h2>
	
	<p id="pinf"> Python is the easiest and the hardest language I've encounter. Because of it's simpleness makes my brain not work efficient and to be honest I missed Java. For this program I made a situation using a stack which I defined a dryer and by using a dyrer in real life, you know that the clothes you put in first will be taken out last, which is a stack.</p>
